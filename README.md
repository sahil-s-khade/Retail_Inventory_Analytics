# Retail Demand Forecasting & Inventory Optimization Platform

An end-to-end data analytics and machine learning project built using Python, PostgreSQL, and Power BI to forecast retail demand, predict stockouts, and optimize inventory decisions.

## Project Objective

The objective of this project is to identify the key factors affecting:

- Future product demand
- Inventory shortages
- Reorder requirements
- Promotion-driven sales
- Competition impact on store sales
- Seasonal and monthly sales trends

## Tools & Technologies

- Python
- Pandas
- PostgreSQL
- Power BI
- Scikit-learn
- Random Forest
- VS Code


## Key Business Scenarios

- Monthly Sales Trend
- Promotion vs Non-Promotion Sales
- Competition Distance vs Sales
- Store Type Performance
- Products Needing Reorder
- Stockout Risk by Store
- Reorder Quantity Recommendation
- Best Sales Months

## Machine Learning Models

### Demand Forecasting Model
A Random Forest Regressor was built to forecast future sales based on:

- Store
- Promotion
- Month
- Competition Distance
- Previous Day Sales
- Previous Week Sales
- Rolling 7 Day Sales

### Stockout Prediction Model
A classification model was built to identify whether a product needs reorder based on:

- Inventory Level
- Demand Forecast
- Safety Stock
- Reorder Point

## Power BI Dashboard

The dashboard contains:

- KPI Cards
  - Total Sales
  - Average Sales
  - Total Stores
  - Products Needing Reorder

- Visuals
  - Monthly Sales Trend
  - Competition Distance vs Sales
  - Monthly Sales by Promotion
  - Top Products Needing Reorder
  - Sales Share by Store Type

## SQL Business Queries

Example business questions answered:

- Which stores generate the highest sales?
- Which products need urgent reorder?
- Which months have the highest sales?
- How does promotion affect sales?
- Which stores have the highest stockout risk?

## Sample Dataset Information

The original processed dataset (`final_featured_data.csv`) was larger than GitHub's file size limit (100 MB). To make the project easy to share and review, a smaller sample dataset was created.

- Original dataset size: ~142 MB
- Sample dataset size: 20,000 rows
- Sample file used in repository:
  - `data/processed/final_featured_data_sample.csv`

The sample dataset preserves the same structure and features as the original dataset, allowing recruiters and reviewers to understand the project workflow without downloading very large files.

## Results & Insights

- Promotions increased average store sales.
- Stores with closer competitors generally had lower sales.
- Certain months showed consistently higher sales demand.
- Reorder recommendations identified products likely to go out of stock.
- The demand forecasting model successfully predicted future sales trends.
- The stockout model helped identify risky inventory situations.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository
2. Install required libraries

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

Run Python scripts in this order:

python/data_cleaning.py
python/merge_data.py
python/feature_engineering.py

python/reorder_recommendation.py

4. Run SQL queries from the `sql/` folder in PostgreSQL:
   - `business_queries.sql`
   - `inventory_kpis.sql`
   - `forecasting_queries.sql`

5. Open the Power BI dashboard file:
